    <p class="text-margin"><strong>Nick Brandt</strong> is a wildlife photographer who manages to capture the animals he photographs in a very personal way. His pictures are very powerful, as can be seen in his latest book <em> Inherit the Dust.</em> As he's mentioned in the afterword of another of his books, <em> On this Earth,</em> "my images are my elegy to these beautiful creatures, to this wrenchingly beautiful world that is steadily, tragically vanishing before our eyes". The way in which he photographs them is quite incredible too. He doesn't use a telephoto lens, but prefers to get up close to them, as it gives him the ability to reveal their personality.  He has also founded the non-profit organization called Big Life Foundation, dedicated to the conservation of Africa's wildlife and ecosystems.
